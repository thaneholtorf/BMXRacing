            <p>
                I have been riding bikes for as long as I can remember. When I was just three years old, my training wheels were taken off for the first time. I was at my grandparents’ house, and my cousin was having his training wheels removed. I wanted mine off too. Once they were taken off, I rode straight down the driveway without hesitation. From that moment on, I developed a deep love for riding bikes. That early experience helped spark my passion and eventually led me to BMX racing.

            <p>
                I started racing BMX when I was five years old and quickly progressed into the expert class that same year. From that point on, BMX racing became a major part of my life. I continued racing competitively throughout my childhood and teenage years, staying dedicated to improving my skills and performance. I remained active in the sport until I was 15 years old, gaining valuable experience, discipline, and a deeper appreciation for BMX racing along the way.

            <h2>Bakersfield Race (2007)</h2>
            <p>
                The Bakersfield race shown below took place when I was seven years old. At the time, I was competing in the 7 Expert class. In the video, I am wearing the blue and white outfit and battling for third place. This race is a great example of the level of competition and determination required in BMX racing. Even at a young age, every position mattered, and each race pushed me to improve my speed, focus, and race strategy.

            <h2>Kidney Crash (Albuquerque 2015)</h2>
            <p>
                The kidney crash shown in the video took place in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 2015, just one day before my 15th birthday. The track was extremely technical, especially the second straight, which featured a challenging sequence of jumps including a tabletop step-down, a bonsai, and a step-up quad leading into the second corner. This section required precision, confidence, and commitment to ride at full speed.
            </p>

            <p>
                During practice on the first day, I never felt completely comfortable jumping that section, but I knew it was the fastest line and necessary to stay competitive. On the second day, there was another practice session before racing. On my final run, I asked my dad to record me. As soon as I took off from the lip of the jump, I immediately felt off balance, as if the lip had slightly bucked me to one side. When I landed, I came up a bit short, and because I was already off balance, my front tire gave out. This caused me to be thrown forward and hit the ground hard.
            </p>

            <p>
                The crash knocked the wind out of me, and when I tried to get up, I felt an intense, sharp pain in my chest. At first, the paramedics believed I had likely cracked a rib. However, after going to the hospital and undergoing multiple scans, the injuries were far more serious. I had suffered a collapsed lung, a lacerated liver, and my kidney had been severely damaged and split into three pieces. As a result, my kidney had to be surgically removed.
            </p>

            <p>
                This crash was one of the most difficult and life-changing moments of my BMX career. It showed me both the risks involved in the sport and the strength required to overcome adversity. Despite the severity of the injury, my passion for BMX and the experiences I gained from racing remain an important part of who I am today.
